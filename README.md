# Formula 1 App

This _currently front end_ React app, utilizing Typescript, Tailwind, and Ergast API offers a data heavy dashboard of Formula 1 information so the user can track their predictions as the season unfolds. Updated with race results, weather, and more from multiple APIs.

As an avid Formula 1 fan, my friends and I wanted an all inclusive f1 web app that includes our season's predictions, current season stats and more.

## Current Season

As the season unfolds each week, the current season section will be updated with the race results, track information and more. The user can sort, filter and manipulate the data to gain knowledge about a certain driver, constructor or track.
